CS193X Final Project Milestone
=============================

Project Name: Image/Video gallery
Your Name: Kaitlin Peng
Your SUNetID: kmpeng

Overview
--------
I haven't really had time to work on the final project because I caught COVID last week, but I came up with a design for the galleries,
asked friends for feedback, and revised the design based on the feedback (design is in /public/images). I've also tried creating the 
basic structure of the gallery in static_gallery.html (like static_board.html from assignment 2). 
I haven't had time to finish coding up the part that actual holds the images/videos, but I've made the sidebar and the notes 
column on the right side. In addition to finishing up the HTML and CSS, I still need to implement all of the javascript parts. 

Project Changes
---------------
I realized I'm going to be very busy until the end of the quarter, so I'm thinking about removing the import/export feature
of galleries since I'm not sure how I would implement it.

Follow-up
---------
Since I'm allowing the user to create multiple galleries, would the best way to create new galleries be to create a new .html
file for each gallery? And then when a gallery is clicked on the sidebar it would go to that .html file?
Also, when adding a new image/video/link, I want a window to pop up that asks the user for the image/video/link they want to add
and the title/description/upload then adds that data to the gallery, but I'm not sure how to implement that.

API
---
I'm not too sure about the APIs yet, but I'm thinking of using this https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/ to get
information on songs for spotify links that are added. To embed Youtube videos, I'm thinking of using the Youtube Data API
https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3. 

External libraries and code
---------------------------
For sign in with google, I plan to use this code https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web. 
I'm not sure about other external libraries yet.

Collaboration and resources
---------------------------
Other than online resources like StackOverflow, just asking users and CAs for feedback on my design.

Anything else?
-------------
I'm pretty confused on what API endpoints I should have because I don't fully understand APIs
