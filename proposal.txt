CS193X Final Project Proposal
=============================
Project Title: Image/Video gallery
Your Name: Kaitlin Peng
Your SUNetID: kmpeng

Description
-----------
Since I dance, I want to be able to upload videos to an image gallery and annotate them with notes about what I want to improve on,
so I want my project to be like the image gallery project example given, but with videos (and other things detailed below) as well. 

My overall idea is an image gallery where you can photos/videos (either by uploading them or with a link), and being able to add titles 
and descriptions to them. In addition, I want to be able to add youtube videos and spotify links to the gallery, and be able to annotate them as well.
I also want to be able to add a notes section to the right of the images in the gallery, so I can make general notes about the gallery
as a whole.

I want each user to be able to have different galleries so they can organize photos together by event/day, so I was thinking of having
a sidebar to the left of all the images with the names of all the galleries you have made that you can switch to. I would also have an add
button that would let them add a new gallery.

Image galleries will be able to be imported/exported, like assignment 2. If I have time, I want to be able to add "Sign in with Google" so users
can get their image galleries saved and linked with their Google account. 

Milestones
----------
Milestone 1 - 2/11:
Come up with a design for the website and make a rough static prototype of it with HTML/CSS. Ask people for feedback on the design.

Milestone 2 - 2/22:
With the feedback from milestone 1, edit the design and fully code up the visual parts of the website (HTML/CSS part).  

Milestone 3 - 3/2:
Implement adding photos/videos/ and youtube/spotify links and being able to add titles to them/annotate them. 
Also implement being able to add notes by themselves.

Milestone 4 - 3/4:
Implement being able to import/export galleries.

Milestone 5 - 3/10:
Ask users for feedback and fix any problems that come up.

(?) Milestone 6:
If I have time, add Google authentication.

External libraries and code
---------------------------
To embed spotify links, I plan to use this code https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/widgets/generate/embed/.
To embed youtube links, I plan to use this code https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780?hl=en.
For sign in with google, I plan to use this code https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web. I'm not sure about other external libraries yet.

Collaboration and resources
---------------------------
Other than online resources like StackOverflow, probably just asking users and CAs for feedback on my design.

Anything else?
